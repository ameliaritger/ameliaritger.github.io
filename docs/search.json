    "text": "While I have explored a variety of questions in an array of systems, my current research uses the strawberry anemone (Corynactis californica) and the black turban snail (Tegula funebralis) to better understand large-scale patterns of intraspecific variation, phenotypic plasticity, and local adaptation. I am an experimental ecologist at heart, happiest when I am exploring out in the field and making new discoveries in the lab."
